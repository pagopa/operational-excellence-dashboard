# OpEx Dashboard

This is a cli to generate PagoPA's Operational Excellence dashboards from open api specs

## Todo

- [ ] Add logging
- [ ] Checkout pytest warnings

- [ ] Why metadata.inputs query is different from metadata.settings query?
- [ ] Can I change axis labels?
- [ ] In PartSubTitle I used endpoint instead of "io-p-appgateway"
